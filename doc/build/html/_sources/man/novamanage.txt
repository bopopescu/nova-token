SYNOPSIS
========

  nova-manage <category> <action> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
===========

nova-manage controls cloud computing instances by managing nova users, nova projects, nova roles, shell selection, vpn connections, and floating IP address configuration. More information about OpenStack Nova is at http://nova.openstack.org.

OPTIONS
=======

The standard pattern for executing a nova-manage command is:
``nova-manage <category> <command> [<args>]``

For example, to obtain a list of all projects:
``nova-manage project list``

Run without arguments to see a list of available command categories:
``nova-manage``

Categories are user, project, role, shell, vpn, and floating. Detailed descriptions are below.

You can also run with a category argument such as user to see a list of all commands in that category:
``nova-manage user``

These sections describe the available categories and arguments for nova-manage.

Nova User
~~~~~~~~~

``nova-manage user admin <username>``

``nova-manage user delete <username>``

    Delete the user with the name <username>.

``nova-manage user exports <username>``

    Outputs a list of access key and secret keys for user to the screen

``nova-manage user list``

    Outputs a list of all the user names to the screen.

``nova-manage user modify <accesskey> <secretkey> <admin?T/F>``

    Updates the indicated user keys, indicating with T or F if the user is an admin user. Leave any argument blank if you do not want to update it.
	
Nova Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``nova-manage project add <projectname>``

    Add a nova project with the name <projectname> to the database.

``nova-manage project create <projectname>``

    Create a new nova project with the name <projectname> (you still need to do nova-manage project add <projectname> to add it to the database).
	
``nova-manage project delete <projectname>``

    Delete a nova project with the name <projectname>.

``nova-manage project environment <projectname> <username>``

    Exports environment variables for the named project to a file named novarc.
    
``nova-manage project list``

    Outputs a list of all the projects to the screen.

``nova-manage project quota <projectname>``

    Outputs the size and specs of the project's instances including gigabytes, instances, floating IPs, volumes, and cores.

``nova-manage project remove <projectname>``

Role names can be one of the following five roles: admin, itsec, projectmanager, netadmin, developer. If you add the project name as the last argument then the role is assigned just for that project, otherwise the user is assigned the named role for all projects. 

``nova-manage role has <username> <projectname>``
