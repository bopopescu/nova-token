Installing Nova on a Single Host
================================

Nova can be run on a single machine, and it is recommended that new users practice managing this type of installation before graduating to multi node systems.

The fastest way to get a test cloud running is through our :doc:`../quickstart`.  But for more detail on installing the system read this doc.


Step 1 and 2: Get the latest Nova code system software
------------------------------------------------------

Depending on your system, the method for accomplishing this varies

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   distros/ubuntu.10.04
   distros/ubuntu.10.10
   distros/others


Step 3: Build and install Nova services
---------------------------------------

Switch to the base nova source directory.

Then type or copy/paste in the following line to compile the Python code for OpenStack Compute.

::

    sudo python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install


When the installation is complete, you'll see the following lines:

::

    Installing nova-network script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-volume script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-objectstore script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-manage script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-scheduler script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-dhcpbridge script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-compute script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-instancemonitor script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-api script to /usr/local/bin
    Installing nova-import-canonical-imagestore script to /usr/local/bin

    Installed /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/nova-2010.1-py2.6.egg
    Processing dependencies for nova==2010.1
    Finished processing dependencies for nova==2010.1


Step 4: Create a Nova administrator
-----------------------------------
Type or copy/paste in the following line to create a user named "anne."::

    sudo nova-manage user admin anne

You see an access key and a secret key export, such as these made-up ones:::

    export EC2_ACCESS_KEY=4e6498a2-blah-blah-blah-17d1333t97fd
    export EC2_SECRET_KEY=0a520304-blah-blah-blah-340sp34k05bbe9a7

Step 5: Create the network 
--------------------------

Type or copy/paste in the following line to create a network prior to creating a project. 

::

    sudo nova-manage network create 10.0.0.0/8 1 64

For this command, the IP address is the cidr notation for your netmask, such as 192.168.1.0/24. The value 1 is the total number of networks you want made, and the 64 value is the total number of ips in all networks.

After running this command, entries are made in the 'networks' and 'fixed_ips' table in the database.

Step 6: Create a project with the user you created
--------------------------------------------------
Type or copy/paste in the following line to create a project named IRT (for Ice Road Truckers, of course) with the newly-created user named anne.

::

    sudo nova-manage project create IRT anne

::

    Write out database with 1 new entries
    Data Base Updated


Step 7: Unzip the nova.zip
--------------------------

You should have a nova.zip file in your current working directory. Unzip it with this command:

::

    unzip nova.zip


You'll see these files extract.

::

    Archive:  nova.zip
     extracting: novarc
     extracting: pk.pem
     extracting: cert.pem
     extracting: nova-vpn.conf
     extracting: cacert.pem


Step 8: Source the rc file
--------------------------
Type or copy/paste the following to source the novarc file in your current working directory.

::

    . novarc


Step 9: Pat yourself on the back :)
-----------------------------------
Congratulations, your cloud is up and running, youâ€™ve created an admin user, created a network, retrieved the user's credentials and put them in your environment.

Now you need an image.


Step 9: Get an image
--------------------
To make things easier, we've provided a small image on the Rackspace CDN. Use this command to get it on your server.

::

    wget http://c2477062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/images.tgz


::

    2010-10-12 21:40:59 (14.1 MB/s) - `images.tgz' saved [58520278/58520278]



Step 10: Decompress the image file
----------------------------------
Use this command to extract the image files:::

    tar xvzf images.tgz

You get a directory listing like so:::

    images
    |-- aki-lucid
    |   |-- image
    |   `-- info.json
    |-- ami-tiny
    |   |-- image
    |   `-- info.json
    `-- ari-lucid
        |-- image
        `-- info.json

Step 11: Send commands to upload sample image to the cloud

Troubleshooting Installation
----------------------------

If you see an "error loading the config file './openssl.cnf'" it means you can copy the openssl.cnf file to the location where Nova expects it and reboot, then try the command again.

::

    cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ~
    sudo reboot
