string|'"""Possible states for xen resource pools.\n\nA pool may be \'created\', in which case the admin has triggered its\ncreation, but the underlying hypervisor pool has not actually being set up\nyet. A pool may be \'changing\', meaning that the underlying hypervisor\npool is being setup. A pool may be \'active\', in which case the underlying\nhypervisor pool is up and running. A pool may be \'dismissed\' when it has\nno hosts and it has been deleted. A pool may be in \'error\' in all other\ncases.\nA \'created\' pool becomes \'changing\' during the first request of\nadding a host. During a \'changing\' status no other requests will be accepted;\nthis is to allow the hypervisor layer to instantiate the underlying pool\nwithout any potential race condition that may incur in master/slave-based\nconfigurations. The pool goes into the \'active\' state when the underlying\npool has been correctly instantiated.\nAll other operations (e.g. add/remove hosts) that succeed will keep the\npool in the \'active\' state. If a number of continuous requests fail,\nan \'active\' pool goes into an \'error\' state. To recover from such a state,\nadmin intervention is required. Currently an error state is irreversible,\nthat is, in order to recover from it a pool must be deleted.\n"""'
