string|'"""\nTwisted Internet: Asynchronous I/O and Events.\n\nTwisted Internet is a collection of compatible event-loops for Python. It contains\nthe code to dispatch events to interested observers and a portable API so that\nobservers need not care about which event loop is running. Thus, it is possible\nto use the same code for different loops, from Twisted\'s basic, yet portable,\nselect-based loop to the loops of various GUI toolkits like GTK+ or Tk.\n"""'
